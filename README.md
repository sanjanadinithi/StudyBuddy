## Mobile App Design

### Overview
In educational settings, a great deal of useful information is often lost because students don't have an efficient way to exchange papers, recordings, lecture notes, and other study materials. Moreover, there is no proper system to access these resources in a centralized way.

**StudyBuddy** aims to solve this problem by:
- Facilitating peer networking.
- Enabling the creation of study groups.
- Allowing the sharing of academic resources.
- Organizing support sessions and collaborative learning.

This mobile app serves as a comprehensive knowledge base, enabling students to:
- Find study partners easily.
- Build user profiles.
- Quickly access shared materials and improve collaboration.

### Features
- **Peer Networking:** Connect with fellow students.
- **Group Creation:** Form study groups based on subjects or interests.
- **Resource Sharing:** Easily share and access lecture notes, recordings, and other study materials.
- **Collaboration Support:** Organize study sessions and provide mutual support.
